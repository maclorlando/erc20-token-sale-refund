üìã Features
ERC20 token (MyToken) with controlled minting

Token sale contract:

Buy tokens with ETH at a fixed rate

Sell tokens back (refund) at the same rate

Ownership-controlled minting and withdrawal

Admin utility contract (GodMode) for quick testing of privileged actions

Deployment scripts (Hardhat with both ethers.js and web3.js)

Solidity tests

üöÄ Getting Started
Deploy & Test with Remix
1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Remix IDE

2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone or download this repository, and upload the contracts/ folder to Remix.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Compile the contracts:

In Remix, go to the Solidity Compiler tab.

Select the appropriate Solidity version (check pragma in the contracts).

Click Compile MyToken.sol, then Compile TokenSale.sol.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the contracts:

In the Deploy & Run Transactions tab:

First deploy MyToken.sol.

Then deploy TokenSale.sol, passing the MyToken contract address as a constructor argument.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Interact with the contracts:

Use the Remix UI to call the functions:

Mint tokens (owner only)

Buy tokens with ETH

Sell tokens back for ETH

Test admin utilities in GodMode.sol (optional)
